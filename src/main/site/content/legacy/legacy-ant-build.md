This procedure applies to versions 1.2 and 2.0 that are built with Ant. To
build Cayenne with Ant, check out the appropriate source code branch from
Subversion and perform the following command to see available targets:


    # cd cayenne/cayenne-ant
    # ant help


Required ant version - 1.6.* or newer; required JDK version - 1.5.* or
newer. Note that compiled binaries are JDK 1.4 compatible, still JDK 1.5 is
needed to build a few extensions.
